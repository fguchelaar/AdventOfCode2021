# 01 [Sonar Sweep] 

_into the abyss_

After first using simple for-loop, I've rewritten the solution to using `zip`.

It turns out that for part 2, you only need to compare the first value of 
"group a" to the last of "group b": the other values are shared, so they don't
weigh more or less for either group.
