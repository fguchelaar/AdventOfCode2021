Part one was, as usual, easy to brute-force. Knowing this wouldn't be the case for part two
I already implemented some memoization. Turned out to be useless as well...

So after reading up on some tips, I came up with the current solution. Pleased with the
performance:

```
Part 1: ******
Part 2: *************

real   0m0.284s
user   0m0.124s
sys    0m0.128s
```
